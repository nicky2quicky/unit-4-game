        // Ideal Drinking Variable: Have a random number generated ranging from 30-50 as your ideal drinking number
        // Score Variable: Have a variable created for the total score of these drinks.

        // WINS & LOSES Variable
                var wins = 0;

        //      Successful Nights variable: starting at 0, and increased by 1 when you win
        //      Unsuccessful Nights variable: starting at 0, and increased when you lose and go over


    // Key Scripts to leverage: 

    // TO start the game
    // 1. Random Math - Random Number between 1-7 for the drink variables, 2. Random Math for the Optimal Drink Number between 30-50, 

    // When the game starts
    // 3. Click On Command - For when you click on a score is computed, 4. jQuery - Random number generated becomes populated in the Optimal Drinking Division, 5. jQuery - When a drink is selected, that number subtracts from the Random number generated through the jQuery. 
    
    // If scenarios:
    //      If the player matches the random number generated for optimal drinking level, then they win. When they win the number of wins goes up one, and the game resets back to new settings.
    //      If the drink generated in the console log is over the optimal drinking, then they lose. The loses goes up one and the game resets again
